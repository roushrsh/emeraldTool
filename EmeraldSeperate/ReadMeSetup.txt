Currently this tool requires a program called node to be setup to run (might be changed to a larger exectuable in the future). Open a terminal and copy the text below into it.


		sudo apt-get update;
		sudo apt-get upgrade;
		sudo apt-get install curl;
		curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -;
		sudo apt-get install -y nodejs;
		

Now right click inside the emerald folder, and open a terminal.
Type:

		npm install

Everything is setup now. 
To run, in the same terminal type:

		npm start
